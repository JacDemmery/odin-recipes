     <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a beloved staple in many households around the world. At its core, lasagna is a layered pasta dish made with wide sheets of flat pasta, such as lasagna noodles, alternated with rich and savory fillings. The layers typically consist of a hearty meat sauce, often made with ground beef or pork, mixed with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and various herbs. In between the meaty layers, creamy béchamel sauce and melted mozzarella or Parmesan cheese add a luxurious texture and a deliciously gooey finish. The entire ensemble is baked to perfection in the oven, resulting in a golden and bubbling masterpiece that captivates the senses with its tantalizing aroma and indulgent flavors</p>
        <p>What makes lasagna particularly versatile is its adaptability to various dietary preferences and ingredient choices. Vegetarian versions substitute the meat with layers of sautéed vegetables, spinach, or ricotta cheese, catering to those who prefer a plant-based diet. Regardless of the variations, lasagna remains a hearty and satisfying dish that brings people together around the dinner table, celebrating the warmth and comfort of home-cooked meals.</p>
